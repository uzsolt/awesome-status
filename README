I hope it's (relative) bug-free and usable - I can use it :)))

If you want a (non-implemented) feature or discovered a bug (this is impossible :) ) please don't hesitate, 
use the "official" bug report and feature request "forum": http://udvzsolt.extra.hu/flyspray/
And if you can send me a simple example program about a wanted plugin (moc,
xmms2, audacious, etc.) please send me and if I can use it will be included.
